## Executive Summary

This report presents the implementation of a player re-identification system for sports footage analysis. The system successfully detects, tracks, and re-identifies players in a 15-second sports video, maintaining consistent player IDs even when players exit and re-enter the camera frame.

## Problem Statement

The challenge was to build a system that can:
1. Detect players in sports footage using a provided YOLOv11 model
2. Track players across frames with unique IDs
3. Re-identify players who exit and re-enter the frame
4. Generate visualizations and analysis reports
5. Provide a reproducible, well-documented solution

## Technical Approach

### 1. System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with four main components:

```
Input Video → Detection → Tracking → Visualization → Output
     ↓           ↓          ↓           ↓           ↓
   Frame    Bounding    Track IDs   Overlay    Video + Data
   Stream    Boxes      & History   Graphics   Files
```

### 2. Detection Module

**Technology**: YOLOv11 (Ultralytics implementation)
- **Model**: Fine-tuned YOLOv11 for player and ball detection
- **Input**: Video frames (BGR format)
- **Output**: Bounding boxes with confidence scores
- **Key Features**:
  - Configurable confidence threshold (default: 0.5)
  - Non-maximum suppression (IoU threshold: 0.45)
  - GPU acceleration support

**Implementation Details**:
```python
class PlayerDetector:
    def __init__(self, model_path, conf_threshold=0.5, iou_threshold=0.45):
        self.model = YOLO(model_path)
        self.conf_threshold = conf_threshold
        self.iou_threshold = iou_threshold
```

### 3. Tracking Module

**Algorithm**: Multi-Object Tracking with Re-Identification
- **Primary Matching**: Intersection over Union (IoU)
- **Secondary Matching**: Feature similarity
- **Assignment**: Hungarian algorithm for optimal matching
- **Track Management**: Creation, updating, and deletion logic

**Key Components**:

#### Track Representation
```python
class PlayerTrack:
    def __init__(self, track_id, bbox, features, frame_id):
        self.track_id = track_id
        self.bbox = bbox
        self.features = features
        self.history = [bbox]
        self.feature_history = [features]
        self.last_seen = frame_id
        self.missed_frames = 0
```

#### Matching Strategy
1. **IoU Matrix**: Calculate IoU between all track-detection pairs
2. **Feature Matrix**: Calculate cosine similarity between feature vectors
3. **Combined Score**: Weighted combination (70% IoU + 30% features)
4. **Threshold Filtering**: Apply minimum thresholds for both metrics
5. **Optimal Assignment**: Use Hungarian algorithm for global optimization

### 4. Re-Identification Approach

**Feature Extraction**:
- **Method**: Histogram-based features with spatial information
- **Process**:
  1. Extract player region from bounding box
  2. Resize to standard size (64x128 pixels)
  3. Convert to grayscale
  4. Compute global histogram (256 bins)
  5. Compute spatial histograms (top/bottom halves)
  6. Concatenate features (total: 512 dimensions)

**Similarity Calculation**:
- **Metric**: Cosine similarity
- **Formula**: `similarity = 1 - cosine_distance(feature1, feature2)`
- **Threshold**: Configurable (default: 0.7)

### 5. Visualization Module

**Features**:
- Bounding box drawing with unique colors per track
- Player ID labels
- Track history trails
- Frame information overlay
- Analysis plots and statistics

**Color Scheme**:
- Each track ID gets a unique color from a predefined palette
- Colors cycle if more tracks than available colors

## Implementation Details

### 1. Pipeline Orchestration

The main pipeline (`PlayerReIDPipeline`) coordinates all components:

```python
def process_video(self, input_path, output_path, results_path):
    # 1. Initialize video capture
    # 2. Process each frame:
    #    - Detect players
    #    - Update tracks
    #    - Visualize results
    #    - Save frame
    # 3. Generate outputs
```

### 2. Data Flow

1. **Frame Processing**:
   - Read frame from video
   - Run YOLOv11 detection
   - Extract features for each detection
   - Update tracking system
   - Visualize results
   - Write to output video

2. **Track Management**:
   - Match new detections to existing tracks
   - Create new tracks for unmatched detections
   - Remove inactive tracks
   - Update track history

3. **Result Generation**:
   - Save frame-wise results to JSON
   - Export CSV with bounding box coordinates
   - Generate analysis plots
   - Create summary statistics

### 3. Performance Optimizations
