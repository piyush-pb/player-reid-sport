- ✅ **Object Detection**: Used YOLOv11 model (`best.pt`) to detect players in each frame
- ✅ **ID Assignment**: Assigned unique IDs to 18 players entering the frame
- ✅ **Player Tracking**: Tracked player movement across all 375 frames
- ✅ **Re-identification**: Maintained consistent IDs when players re-enter the frame
- ✅ **Visualization**: Generated output video with bounding boxes and player IDs
- ✅ **Data Export**: Created CSV and JSON files with frame-wise tracking data
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for running the pipeline
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and technical report

### Technical Stack ✅
- ✅ **Python**: Industry standard for CV/ML with strong library support
- ✅ **YOLOv11**: Ultralytics implementation with PyTorch backend
- ✅ **OpenCV**: Video processing and visualization
- ✅ **Tracking**: Custom IoU + feature similarity tracking algorithm
- ✅ **Visualization**: Matplotlib for analysis plots
- ✅ **CLI**: argparse-based command-line interface
- ✅ **Output Formats**: CSV, JSON, MP4, PNG
- ✅ **Documentation**: Markdown documentation

## 📊 Processing Results

### Video Processing Statistics
